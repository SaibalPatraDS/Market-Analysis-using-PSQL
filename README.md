# Marketing Analysis Project

This project focuses on conducting a comprehensive marketing analysis using PostgreSQL. The goal is to derive valuable insights from a dataset of marketing interactions and customer behavior. Below, you'll find an overview of the project, its objectives, and key SQL queries used for analysis.

## Project Overview

- **Objective**: To perform a detailed marketing analysis on a dataset containing user interactions and conversions.
- **Dataset**: The dataset is stored in a PostgreSQL database and consists of user information, marketing channel data, conversion status, and more.

## Key Questions Addressed

The project addresses various domains of market analysis, including:

1. **Conversion Rate Analysis**: Identifying overall and variant-specific conversion rates.
2. **Marketing Channel Effectiveness**: Determining which marketing channels have the highest and lowest conversion rates.
3. **A/B Testing**: Analyzing the performance difference between 'personalization' and 'non-personalization' variants.
4. **Retention Analysis**: Calculating user retention rates based on subscribing channel and language preferences.
5. **Churn Analysis**: Identifying factors contributing to user cancellations.
6. **Time Series Analysis**: Examining trends and seasonality in conversion rates.
7. **Language Preference Impact**: Investigating the impact of displaying content in the preferred language.
8. **Marketing Campaign Performance**: Identifying top-performing marketing campaigns or variants.
9. **Cohort Analysis**: Estimating customer lifetime value (LTV) and analyzing user behavior over time.
10. **Funnel Analysis**: Visualizing the user journey and identifying drop-off points.

## SQL Queries

The project relies on PostgreSQL and includes a variety of SQL queries to answer the above questions. Some of the key SQL queries include:

- Calculating conversion rates
- Finding the most effective marketing channels
- Conducting A/B tests
- Analyzing user retention and churn
- Exploring time series data
- Investigating language preferences
- Assessing marketing campaign performance
- Cohort analysis
- Funnel analysis

## Getting Started

To replicate and extend this analysis, you can:

1. Set up a PostgreSQL database.
2. Import your marketing data into the database.
3. Adapt and run the provided SQL queries for your dataset.
4. Visualize the results using your preferred data visualization tools.
